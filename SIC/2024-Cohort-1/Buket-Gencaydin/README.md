# (Work in progress!) ADHD Prediction using ADHD-200 Dataset
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using the ADHD-200 dataset. The dataset consists of neuroimaging data, including structural and functional MRI scans, from individuals diagnosed with ADHD and control subjects.

### Introduction
ADHD is extremely difficult to diagnose and relies on subjective self-reported surveys. There is definitely an unmet need for more objective metrics for diagnosis. This project utilizes the ADHD-200 dataset to predict the presence of ADHD using advanced machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a robust predictive model and contribute to the understanding of ADHD through neuroimaging data.

### Dataset
The ADHD-200 dataset is a publicly available collection of neuroimaging data curated by the ADHD-200 Consortium. It includes resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI (sMRI) scans from 973 individuals, with metadata such as age, gender, diagnostic status, and medication status.
